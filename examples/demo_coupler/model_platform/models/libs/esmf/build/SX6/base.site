# Location of MPI (Message Passing Interface) software

# We recommend using SGI's MPI implementation over MPICH on the Origin and 
# Powerchallenge.

# If you are using the MPICH implementation of MPI with version BELOW 1.1,
# you should remove the -DESMC_HAVE_INT_MPI_COMM. If you are using MPICH Version 1.1
# or SGI's version of MPI you MUST retain it.
